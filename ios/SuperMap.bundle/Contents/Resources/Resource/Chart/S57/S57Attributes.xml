		<Remarks>All necessary information for conversion of geographic coordinates from most of the Geodetic Datums in the above list to WGS-84 is contained in the "User's Handbook on Datum Transformations involving WGS-84", prepared by the US Defense Mapping Agency and which is available from the IHB as IHO Publication S-60 (English and French Versions), along with an associated standard datum transformation software on floppy disk called "MADTRAN". The resulting latitude and longitude offsets can be encoded in the attribute SHIPAM.</Remarks>
